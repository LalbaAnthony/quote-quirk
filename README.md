# ðŸ“œ - Quote Quirk

"Life is always better with nonsense quotes"

This afternoon project is a very simple website, made with a fews JS lines, with the only purpose of generating non-sense imaginary french quotes.<br>
Was pretty fun to trying to code frenches grammar rules while.<br>
'D love to improve this website by feeding it with huge amount of data and even more quotes templates, rules, ...<br>
But for now im still at the point where i try to figure out how to deal with lack of data so ... Come back in fews months !<br>
